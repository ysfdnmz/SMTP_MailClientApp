# SMTP_MailClientApp
Simple Mail Client Application using SMTP and Java Mail library (only Gmail tested)

Note: if you want you use the outbox you need the change label which is "[Gmail]/Gönderilmiş Postalar" in Outbox.java

You need to translate it into your language. for example [Gmail]Outbox (I don't know if Outbox label works, maybe 'sent mails' works, I don't know.)
